# ember-mirage

Helper utilities to start mirage during testing or development

## Compatibility

- Ember.js v3.28 or above
- Embroider or ember-auto-import v2

## Installation

```
ember install ember-mirage
```

## Usage

See [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/tutorial/part-1/) for creating and defining the server. These docs say to create 
the server in `src/server.js` since the tutorial is using react. For ember we suggest `app/mirage/server.js`
